# MPPT Controller
Simple Arduino-based MPPT Solar Controller

This is the beginnings of a proper charge controller, and it will grow over time.

Schematic is located on my EasyEDA pages.

## FUNCTIONS COMPLETED
The basic algorithm (Peturb and Observe) is implemented and has been validated on a small panel.

The LCD panel displays power output and PWM percentage.

The rotary encoder is not yet implemented.

A second analog channel for pre-controller voltage is not yet implemented, but allowed for.

SPI is allowed for, but not required.
